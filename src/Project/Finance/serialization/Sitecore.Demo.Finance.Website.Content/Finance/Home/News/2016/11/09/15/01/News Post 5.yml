        <p>Today Helix Financial announced PocketStripe, a new mobile wallet and easy way to pay. Launching later this summer, PocketStripe is integrated into the existing Helix Financial mobile app, making for a comprehensive, mobile banking and payment experience.</p>
        <p>PocketStripe quickly and conveniently adds eligible Helix debit and credit cards so that customers may easily make purchases by tapping their smartphones at millions of NFC-enabled payment terminals worldwide. For more seamless money management, customers may also view account balance information within the app before and immediately after a purchase.</p>
        <p>With mobile at the forefront of payment technology, and Helix expects PocketStripe to provide a richer understanding of the quickly evolving landscape. When a customer makes a payment with PocketStripe, all transactions are monitored with Helix&rsquo;s fraud detection systems. Purchases also are protected, which means customers are not responsible for promptly reported unauthorized transactions.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>PocketStripe was built in-house and designed to provide a seamless banking experience for customers. Across the globe, Helix Financial team members have been beta testing PocketStripe, and providing valuable feedback ahead of the product launch. In addition to the ability to make payments at NFC-enabled payment terminals, customers will also be able to use PocketStripe, along with other leading mobile wallet providers, to conduct ATM transactions without using a physical debit or ATM card.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Continuous innovation enables Helix Financial to save customers time and money, reduce fraud, and drive loyalty. With mobile ever-present in today&rsquo;s world, innovation around mobile will continue to be a key area of focus.</p>
        Recent survey data reported that almost 28% of smartphone owners reported having made a mobile payment in the last 12 months and 53% of all smartphone owners with a bank account have used mobile banking. These statistics reflect the focus that Helix has put on the mobile banking channel, the company&rsquo;s fastest growing channel, with more than 22 million mobile banking customers.
