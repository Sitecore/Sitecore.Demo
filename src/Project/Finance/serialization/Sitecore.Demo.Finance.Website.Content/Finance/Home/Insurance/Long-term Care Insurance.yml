        <h3>Protect your assets by planning ahead</h3>
        <p>Help maintain what you&rsquo;ve worked for throughout your life with long-term care coverage. Many people, in their later years, require assistance to be able to enjoy the comfort of living in their homes. Because typical insurance often does not pay for the care they need, many receive help exclusively from family caregivers.</p>
        <p>Fortunately, a long-term care coverage policy offered through Helix Financial can help you:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Stay in control of your finances and protect your assets</li>
            <li>Receive compensation for in-home care recommended by a doctor</li>
            <li>Choose a nursing home or other facility of your choice</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Quality care wherever you choose</h3>
        <p>Long-term care coverage may provide coverage for a visiting or live-in caregiver, housekeeper, therapist or private nurse. With this coverage you can control the quality of your care and choose where to receive it. The following services may be covered:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Assisted living services</li>
            <li>Adult daycare</li>
            <li>Respite care</li>
            <li>Hospice care</li>
            <li>Nursing home costs</li>
            <li>Alzheimer's facilities.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Unexpected illness or disability can dramatically affect your finances. However, with some planning now, you can be prepared ahead of time, on your terms. Contact a Helix specialist today to learn more.</p>
