        <p>Three out of four small and midsize businesses that encountered banking fraud during the past year were victimized online, according to a new study.</p>
        <p>Over half of those companies experienced some form of banking-related fraud during the previous 12 months, according to the report. About 75% of those cases involved online account takeover. Some 61% of SMBs that fell prey to bank fraud were victimized more than once.</p>
        <p>The study included 600 businesses with fewer than 150 employees and average annual revenue of $15.5 million. All respondents were owners with access to their company's corporate bank accounts. Last year's study found the same rate of web-based fraud&mdash;75% of all cases occurred online.</p>
        <p>Small and midsize businesses that manage their money with smaller banks aren't any more likely to run into fraud as it occurred just as often at midsize or large financial banks. The study also found that 78% of bank scams involving SMB accounts weren't discovered until after funds were transferred outside of the bank. The study also found that some banks are doing a better job combating online crime than others, but the segment overall is losing the fight. Some 33% of the victimized SMBs included in the study said their bank didn't compensate them for fraud-related losses, while another 30% were only partially paid back. Just 7% of those surveyed said their bank fully covered their fraud-related losses.</p>
        <p>Adding another potential wrinkle in online banking security for SMBs: More than one-third (38%) of respondents said they access their company's accounts on a tablet or smartphone, up from 23%. Mobile is a new and vulnerability point, primarily because it's more frequent access and more variability in the device being used to access SMB accounts. Mobile adoption further fuels the argument that banks need to focus on account protection from a server and back-end perspective, rather than worrying about every potential endpoint. The best and most effective way of protecting against fraud is to examine all of the information about the individual user as they access their SMB accounts online.</p>
